# Typography in Themes

## Base Components

Use the **Text** and **Heading** components to render titles and body copy. These components share `size` and `weight` props and map to the underlying type system to ensure consistent typography throughout your app.

## Typographic Principles

The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.

```jsx
<Heading mb="2" size="4">Typographic principles</Heading>
<Text>
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.
</Text>
```

## Formatting Components

You can compose formatting components to add emphasis, signal importance, present code, and more.

Example:

```jsx
<Text>
  The <Em>most</Em> important thing to remember is,{" "}
  <Strong>stay positive</Strong>.
</Text>
```

Output:
_The most important thing to remember is, **stay positive**._

## Type Scale

The typographic system is based on a **9-step size scale**. Each step includes values for font size, line height, and letter spacing, designed to work in harmony.

```jsx
<Text size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
```

### Type Scale Steps

Step 1: Size 12px, Letter Spacing 0.0025em, Line Height 16px
Step 2: Size 14px, Letter Spacing 0em, Line Height 20px
Step 3: Size 16px, Letter Spacing 0em, Line Height 24px
Step 4: Size 18px, Letter Spacing -0.0025em, Line Height 26px
Step 5: Size 20px, Letter Spacing -0.005em, Line Height 28px
Step 6: Size 24px, Letter Spacing -0.00625em, Line Height 30px
Step 7: Size 28px, Letter Spacing -0.0075em, Line Height 36px
Step 8: Size 35px, Letter Spacing -0.01em, Line Height 40px
Step 9: Size 60px, Letter Spacing -0.025em, Line Height 60px

## Font Weight

The typography system supports the following weights. These can be customized to map to your typeface.

- **Light**
- **Regular**
- **Medium**
- **Bold**

### Example

```jsx
<Text size="6">
  <Flex direction="column">
    <Text weight="light">Light</Text>
    <Text weight="regular">Regular</Text>
    <Text weight="medium">Medium</Text>
    <Text weight="bold">Bold</Text>
  </Flex>
</Text>
```

### Default Font Weights

- Light: 300
- Regular: 400
- Medium: 500
- Bold: 700
