# Breakpoints in Radix Themes

Radix Themes provides built-in **breakpoints** to easily create adaptive layouts for different screen sizes.

## Available Sizes

Each breakpoint corresponds to a fixed screen width. Breakpoints are **min-width based**, meaning they apply when the screen width is equal to or greater than the specified value.

- **initial**: 0px (Phones - portrait)
- **xs**: 520px (Phones - landscape)
- **sm**: 768px (Tablets - portrait)
- **md**: 1024px (Tablets - landscape)
- **lg**: 1280px (Laptops)
- **xl**: 1640px (Desktops)

## Usage

Most component size and layout props accept a **Responsive object** to modify the given prop across different breakpoints.

### Example

You can define component sizes for different screen sizes by passing an object with breakpoint keys and corresponding values:

```jsx
<Heading
  size={{
    initial: "3", // For phones (portrait)
    md: "5", // For tablets (landscape)
    xl: "7", // For desktops
  }}
/>
```

In this example:

- The `Heading` size will be `"3"` on phones (portrait).
- The `Heading` size will change to `"5"` on tablets (landscape).
- The `Heading` size will be `"7"` on desktops (larger screens).

This approach ensures a responsive design that adapts to varying screen sizes.
